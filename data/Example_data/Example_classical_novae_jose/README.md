#### Additional information from the providers of the trajectory:
The model follows 1 outburst from the initiation of the accretion stage and through the explosion, expansion and ejection.
It relies on a 1.25 Msun, ONe WD hosting the explosion.
For simplicity, it is assumed pre-enriched, accreted material with a composition corresponding to 50% solar (from Lodders 2009) and 50% outer layers of the WD substrate (from Ritossa et al. 1996).
The initial luminosity of the WD is assumed to be 10^-2 Lsun, and the mass-accretion rate is 2x10^-10 Msun yr^-1.
Calculations were done with the hydrodynamic, Lagrangian, implicit, 1D code "SHIVA". References to this can be found in the ApJ paper Jose & Hernanz 1998, and in my book on "Stellar Explosions - Hydrodynamics and Nucleosynthesis" (Jose 2016).

The trajectory does not follow exactly what happens in a real nova explosion, but accounts approximately for the physical conditions at the innermost, envelope shell.
This trajectory can be used in reaction-rate sensitive studies, but cannot be used for detailed nuclesynthesis studies (i.e., to determine isotopic abundances).
