#### Additional information from the providers of the trajectory:
Trajectory and initial abundances used in Nishimura et al. 2017, MNRAS, Volume 469, Issue 2, p.1752-1767. The trajectory covers both central He-burning and shell C-burning. It was originally extracted from a solar metallicity 25 Msun model (Hirschi, Meynet & Maeder 2004), and was chosen because it corresponds roughly tothe average weak s-process production in massive stars weighted overthe initial mass function.

The trajectory does not follow exactly what happens in real stars, but  provides  the conditions that lead to an s-process production similar to that predicted  using full stellar models. Therefore, this trajectory can be used for nuclear sensitivity studies, but it cannot be used to compute stellar yields.

Concerning the final abundances, the final overproduction factors, based on the z0r0model, are shown. Nucleosynthesis results using two rates for 17O(α,γ)21Ne are given: for the standard rate by CF88 (red diamonds) and the CF88 rate divided by 10 (blue circles, see paper for details).
