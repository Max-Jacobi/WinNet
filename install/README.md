## Setup scripts
This folder contains some helpful scripts to install necessary packages on Ubuntu.
It is not mandatory to use the script and one can also follow the code documentation to
install the intel fortran compiler and python packages manually. Use the setup script
on your own risk.

You can install Anaconda (if not already installed), the intel fortran compiler from
the OneAPI, and all necessary python packages by running:

```
chmod +x setup_linux.sh
./setup_linux.sh
```
